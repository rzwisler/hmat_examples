In our base configuration we have two proximity domains, 0 and 1, each with a
CPU and memory local to that CPU:

+------------------+     +------------------+
|Proximity Domain 0|     |Proximity Domain 1|
|CPU 0             +-----+CPU 1             |
|Memory for CPU 0  |     |Memory for CPU 1  |
+------------------+     +------------------+

The SRAT and HMAT in this sample modify that configuration by adding two
memory-only NUMA nodes, each of which is local to one of the CPUs:

+------------------+     +------------------+
|Proximity Domain 0|     |Proximity Domain 1|
|CPU 0             +-----+CPU 1             |
|Memory for CPU 0  |     |Memory for CPU 1  |
+--------+---------+     +--------+---------+
         |                        |
         |                        |
+--------+---------+     +--------+---------+
|Proximity Domain 2|     |Proximity Domain 3|
|HBM local to CPU 0|     |HBM local to CPU 1|
+------------------+     +------------------+

We pretend that each of these new memory-only NUMA nodes has High-Bandwidth
Memory, so in the HMAT we will double the read and write bandwidth for this
memory versus the memory found in NUMA nodes 0 and 1.
