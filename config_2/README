In our base configuration we have two proximity domains, 0 and 1, each with a
CPU and memory local to that CPU:

+------------------+     +------------------+
|Proximity Domain 0|     |Proximity Domain 1|
|CPU 0             +-----+CPU 1             |
|Memory for CPU 0  |     |Memory for CPU 1  |
+------------------+     +------------------+

The SRAT and HMAT in this sample modify that configuration by moving the
memory into four memory-only NUMA nodes, two of which represent normal DRAM
and two which represent High-Bandwidth Memory.  One of each type is assigned
as local to each CPU:

+------------------+     +------------------+
|Proximity Domain 2|     |Proximity Domain 3|
|MEM local to CPU 0|     |MEM local to CPU 1|
+--------+---------+     +--------+---------+
         |                        |
+--------+---------+     +--------+---------+
|Proximity Domain 0|     |Proximity Domain 1|
|CPU 0             +-----+CPU 1             |
+--------+---------+     +--------+---------+
         |                        |
+--------+---------+     +--------+---------+
|Proximity Domain 4|     |Proximity Domain 5|
|HBM local to CPU 0|     |HBM local to CPU 1|
+------------------+     +------------------+

We pretend that the memory in proximity domains 4 and 5 is High-Bandwidth
Memory, so in the HMAT we will double the read and write bandwidth for this
memory versus the memory found in NUMA nodes 2 and 3.
